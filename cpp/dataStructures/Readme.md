Collections in Java and STL (Standard Template Library) in C++ Container is an object that stores a collection of other objects (elements).

Container manages the storage space for its elements and 
provides member functions to access them (mostly 
through iterators)
Example = Stack, Map, Vector etc.

Insertion, Searching and Deletion*/ 
Iterator allow to explore elements in DSs.

Containers are of 4 types. That are 
1.Sequence - Array (Array has fixed size.), Vector (Vector can grow.), Deque (Doubly Ended Queue can do insertion and deletion at both ends.), Forward List (Singly Linked list), List (Doubly Singly Linked list)

2.Associative (uses tree like str and data is sorted) - Set (Stores collection of elements that are unique, will be ordered), Map (Used to store collection of key value pairs, uses BST, ), Multiset (can contain duplicate keys), Multimap (one key can have multiple values.)

3.Unordered-Associative - Unordered Set, Unordered Map, Unordered Mj

4.containers-Adaptors.
